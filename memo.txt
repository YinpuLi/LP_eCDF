The files should be checked/updated according to the following order:

0. packages_in_use.R
   Any new packages being used in any other files should be added here.

1. time_data.R
   This file contains the original survival time and the domain, (0, 250)
   Unless new dataset is being used, otherwise this file should not be changed.

2. params.R
   This is deciding N and related  quantities.
   Maybe N should be tested from smaller numbers.

3. set_grid.R
   Now, I have added 
	* a = 0, min of domain
   	* b = 250, max of domain

4. inital_inflections.R
   This is only influenced by set_grid.R file, but the x_grid is used in validate potential values.
   There are functions of transformations among:
	* inflection points' locations
	* inflection points' values
	* inflection points' values' reparameterization

4. KS_criteria.R
   This file provided 
	* the original ecdf, KS bands
	* new ecdf and new KS bands adaptive to the current grid setting

   
5. con2_pass_KS_criteria.R
   This file directly uses(and only influenced by) the results from KS_criteria.R
   
6. con1_valid_cdf.R
   This file directly uses(and only influenced by) the results from KS_criteria.R
   
7. con3_unimodal.R
   This file directly uses initial_inflections.R
   The most annoying part is the get_unimodality_const_dir() function
	* This function decides the direction of unimodality constraints
	* if any of the index of changing the direction is out of bound, there could be issues.
	* So be careful with the initial_inflections.R file.

8. constraint.R
   This file uses the following 3 files:
	* con1_valid_cdf.R
	* con2_pass_KS_criteria.R
	* con3_unimodal.R

9. dens_obj.R
   It depends on set_grid.R file.
   This files handles objective function coefficients' vector.
   Now, it only handles the density estimation problem.

10. LP_fix_inflec.R
    It depends on dens.obj.R and constraints.R files.
    This file solves the LP problems.
   TODO: do not update solveLP_greedy yet, before getting result in mat.csv

11. LP_fix_inflec2.R
   TODO: I did not change anything here yet.
	Because I forgot what it is.

12. NM.R
    It depends only on LP_fix_inflec.R file.
